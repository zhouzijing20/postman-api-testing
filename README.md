# API Testing Practice Project

This is a collection of my API testing practices using Postman.

## What I Did
- Sent GET, POST requests to a public API (JSONPlaceholder).
- Used Environment Variables to manage the base URL.
- Wrote automated test scripts in JavaScript to validate response status codes and data.

## How to Use
1. Import the `My_Test_Project.postman_collection.json` file into Postman.
2. Import the `My Test Environment.postman_environment.json` file (if applicable).
3. Run the requests and view the test results.
